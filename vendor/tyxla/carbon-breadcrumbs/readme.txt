A basic WordPress plugin for breadcrumbs with advanced capabilities for extending.

== Description ==

Provides the theme and plugin developers an easy way to build and implement highly customizable breadcrumb functionality, specifically tailored to their needs.
Supports a lot of filters and hooks, and is written in OOP style, giving developers full control over the breadcrumb trail items and appearance.
This plugin can also be embedded in themes, instead of installing it as a WordPress plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install Carbon Breadcrumbs either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. That's it. You're ready to go! Please, refer to the Configuration section for examples and usage information.

== Configuration ==

The most basic way to insert Carbon Breadcrumbs in your theme code is:

`<?php Carbon_Breadcrumb_Trail::output(); ?>`

If you want to specify various breadcrumb rendering options, you can specify them in an array, like this:

`<?php
Carbon_Breadcrumb_Trail::output(array(
    'glue' => ' &gt; ', // glue between breadcrumb items
    'link_before' => '',
    'link_after' => '',
    'wrapper_before' => '',
    'wrapper_after' => '',
    'title_before' => '',
    'title_after' => '',
    'min_items' => 2,
    'last_item_link' => true,
    'display_home_item' => true,
    'home_item_title' => __('Home', 'carbon_breadcrumbs'),
    'renderer' => 'Carbon_Breadcrumb_Trail_Renderer',
));
?>`
